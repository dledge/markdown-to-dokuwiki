This is a _very_ bare-bones script to convert Markdown to the DokuWiki format.

Disclaimers:
 - It is by no means exhaustive - some markdown tags aren't presently implemented
 - It hasn't been super extensively tested
 - As it is based on regular expressions, it may affect certain types of code present in block code segments

Usage: `python md2doku.py inputfile.md`
